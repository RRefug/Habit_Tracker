Task: Finish adding habits to habits.html page. Done!
Task: Be able to view newly added habits on habits.html page. Done!

New Tasks!!!!
1. Figure out how to use "local storage" (link can be found on habits.js) 
to save newly added habits, created on habits.html, and bring to index.html. 


2. Then, implement that functionality so that newly added habits appear on both html pages.

3. Try to see why your deplyment is doing this error:
GET https://rrefug.github.io/JavaScript/habits.js net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found) (probably just the structure in habits.html where we have the redirect back to landing page.)



--------
Idea below:
--------
// Behavior on the habits html page


// If asked:

// “Why can’t you reuse the same object across pages?”

// Strong answer:

// “Each page load creates a new JavaScript runtime. To persist state, you need STORAGE or a backend.”


Real apps do this.
// User created
// → Habits loads from localStorage
// → User navigates to habits.html
// → Habits reloads from localStorage
// → Same data, new instance

// Save habits (when modified)
// localStorage.setItem("habits", JSON.stringify(this.habits_list));

// Load habits (in constructor)
// constructor() {
//     const saved = localStorage.getItem("habits");
//     this.habits_list = saved ? JSON.parse(saved) : [];
// }



// LOOK AT THIS DOCUMENTATION FOR LOCAL STORAGE DOcumentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API/Using_the_Web_Storage_API

TODO TASKS:

1. Figure out how to use "local storage" (link can be found on habits.js) 
to save newly added habits, created on habits.html, and bring to index.html.  (make a new branch.)


2. Then, implement that functionality so that newly added habits appear on both html pages.

3. Try to see why your deplyment is doing this error:
GET https://rrefug.github.io/JavaScript/habits.js net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found) (probably just the structure in habits.html where we have the redirect back to landing page.) 
[Done, HTML file <script> tag had a path issue ..//JavaScript was better than //Javascript]


No Errors just new logic we need to figure out.
Right now, our app is able to add habits and save the data we have pushed to localstorage. I am trying to see what is a good way to do this. Might have to roll back one.
Updating the localStorage data every single time we added a habit was good. However, it caused an issue of displaying to the page once we got more than one habit submitted.
Maybe refactor and make a new function to ensure render_habits() 's displaying functionality doesn't merge with the localstorage's existence behaviors.
Or.
Just roll back and make sure the habits_obj is pushed once everything in the array is added and the user pushes the update button. (better option)

New task:
- Figure out first time and current user behavior when launching the page.

Current tasks:

- Figure out how to use "local storage" (youtube tutorial was very helpful) to save newly added habits, created on habits.html. (make a new branch.)
- Then, bring habits_obj to index.html when done on the branch. Implement that functionality so that newly added habits appear on both html pages.
- Figure out first time and current user behavior when launching the habits.html page.

PLAN:
Also, duuude I feel improvement. Try to use this line :
        * Don't touch below this line yet ** 
a lot more.it's very helpful!!

- Decided to go with the send all habits at once button after adding each one to their list. 
- That is 2 different functionalities. Make sure they do not interwine. 

NEW TASKS:
- Implement Delete and maybe Edit. Edit might come later, but delete for sure since testing.
- Find out a way to safely initialize habits.js in main(bottom of habits.js) because right now, index.html tries to call functions of Habits class with a null object from habits.js module.
