Task: Finish adding habits to habits.html page. Done!
Task: Be able to view newly added habits on habits.html page. Done!

New Tasks!!!!
1. Figure out how to use "local storage" (link can be found on habits.js) 
to save newly added habits, created on habits.html, and bring to index.html. 


2. Then, implement that functionality so that newly added habits appear on both html pages.

3. Try to see why your deplyment is doing this error:
GET https://rrefug.github.io/JavaScript/habits.js net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found) (probably just the structure in habits.html where we have the redirect back to landing page.)



--------
Idea below:
--------
// Behavior on the habits html page


// If asked:

// “Why can’t you reuse the same object across pages?”

// Strong answer:

// “Each page load creates a new JavaScript runtime. To persist state, you need STORAGE or a backend.”


Real apps do this.
// User created
// → Habits loads from localStorage
// → User navigates to habits.html
// → Habits reloads from localStorage
// → Same data, new instance

// Save habits (when modified)
// localStorage.setItem("habits", JSON.stringify(this.habits_list));

// Load habits (in constructor)
// constructor() {
//     const saved = localStorage.getItem("habits");
//     this.habits_list = saved ? JSON.parse(saved) : [];
// }



// LOOK AT THIS DOCUMENTATION FOR LOCAL STORAGE DOcumentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API/Using_the_Web_Storage_API
